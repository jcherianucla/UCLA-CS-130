# GradePortal Backend

This is the overall backend for GradePortal written in Golang. It is a pure RESTful API backend, serving data through JSON requests made by the frontend.

## Requirements
This application is made with the need for only a single dependency, that is [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/installation/)

## Usage

Simply run the `start.sh` script and the docker container should start running. This will throw up an HTTP server listening on port `3000`.
